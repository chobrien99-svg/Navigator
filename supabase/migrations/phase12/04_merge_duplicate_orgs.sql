-- =============================================================================
-- Merge duplicate organizations
-- =============================================================================
-- Two merges:
--   1. alize-pharma-3   → amolyt-pharma    (renamed in real life)
--   2. wynd             → anycommerce      (Wynd was renamed to AnyCommerce)
--
-- Strategy: for each linked table, redirect rows from source org to target
-- where no unique constraint would be violated, then delete the leftover
-- rows on source (they would be duplicates of target's). Finally enrich the
-- target with any non-null fields the target is missing, and delete source.
--
-- Re-runnable: each step is idempotent. If a merge has already happened the
-- DO block exits early when source org is not found.
